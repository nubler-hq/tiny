We're excited to introduce the Integrated API Keys System, a powerful new feature that enables secure integration between SaaS Boilerplate and external services. Create, manage, and secure API keys for seamless connections and automations.

You can now integrate securely:

- **New**: API key management included by default.
- **One-click setup**: Generate keys from Settings → Organization → API Keys.
- **Secure by design**: Granular permissions, expiration dates, and key rotation.
- **Works with**: External services, custom integrations, and third-party applications.
- **Extensible**: Configure scopes and monitor usage for optimal security.
