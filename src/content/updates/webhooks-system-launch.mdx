We're excited to introduce the Integrated Webhooks System, a powerful new feature that enables real-time event notifications to external systems. Automatically send data when events occur in your SaaS application, enabling seamless integrations and automations.

You can now connect your workflows effortlessly:

- **New**: Real-time webhook configuration included by default.
- **One-click setup**: Create webhooks from Settings → Organization → Webhooks.
- **Secure by design**: HTTPS-only endpoints with authentication headers and signature verification.
- **Supports**: User events, organization changes, data updates, and system notifications.
- **Extensible**: Configure custom headers and monitor delivery logs for reliability.

Ready to automate your integrations? Set up your first webhook and start receiving real-time updates.
