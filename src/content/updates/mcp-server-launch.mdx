We're excited to introduce the Built-in MCP Server, a powerful new feature that seamlessly integrates your SaaS application with AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows these tools to interact directly with your workspace, enabling them to perform actions, retrieve data, and execute tasks within your organization—turning your AI into an intelligent extension of your team.

You can now manage your workspace with ChatGPT and other supported tools effortlessly:

- **New**: Organization-scoped MCP Server included by default.
- **One-click setup**: Copy your org’s MCP URL from Settings → Organization → Model Context Protocol.
- **Secure by design**: Per-organization API key, easy rotation, and role-validated access.
- **Works with**: ChatGPT Connectors, Claude remote servers, Cursor, Cline, Windsurf, Roo Code, and VS Code Copilot.
- **Extensible**: Expose any Igniter.js controller as an MCP tool by adding it to the MCP server router.

Want help adding your own tools? Open Settings now and connect your assistant.
