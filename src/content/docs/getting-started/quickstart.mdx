title: Quickstart
description: Get started with the SaaS Boilerplate by installing it via CLI or manually, then setting up your local development environment.
---

Welcome to the SaaS Boilerplate! This guide will walk you through getting the project up and running on your local machine. Whether you're new to the project or looking to contribute, we'll cover two installation methods: using our CLI tool for a streamlined setup, or manually cloning the repository for more control. By the end, you'll have a fully functional application with a database, authentication, and built-in documentation.

## Before You Begin

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js 22+**: Required for running the application and its dependencies.
- **Docker Desktop**: Needed to run PostgreSQL locally for the database.
- **Stripe Account** (optional): Only if you plan to test billing and payment flows.

## Installation

Choose your preferred method to get the SaaS Boilerplate code on your machine. The CLI method is recommended for new projects as it automates much of the initial setup.

The CLI tool simplifies the process by creating a new project directory, installing dependencies, and setting up initial configuration files.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create a new project

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx saas-boilerplate@latest create my-saas-app
```

Replace `my-saas-app` with your desired project name. This command will guide you through an interactive setup process.

</Step>

<Step>

### Follow the CLI prompts

The CLI will ask you a series of questions to configure your project:

```txt filename="Terminal"
What is the name of your project? (Required)? my-app
Choose GitHub authentication method (HTTPS or SSH)? https, ssh
Choose your preferred package manager? npm, yarn, pnpm, bun
Do you want to configure Stripe for payments now? No / Yes
Configure Code Agents (LIA) now? No / Yes
Start the development server now? No / Yes
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Navigate to your project

```bash
cd my-saas-app
```

Your project is now ready for the setup steps below.

If you prefer more control or want to contribute to the boilerplate itself, clone the repository directly.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/felipebarcelospro/saas-boilerplate
cd saas-boilerplate
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Install dependencies

Choose your package manager and run the install command:

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn"]} defaultIndex={0}>
<Tab>

```bash
npm install
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```bash
pnpm install
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```bash
yarn install
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

This installs all the required packages, including Next.js, Prisma, Igniter.js, and UI libraries.

</Step>

<Step>

### Start PostgreSQL with Docker

Launch the local database using Docker Compose:

```bash
npm run docker:up
```

This command starts PostgreSQL and any other services defined in `docker-compose.yml`, providing a local database instance for development.

</Step>

<Step>

### Configure environment variables

Copy the sample environment file and customize it for your setup:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` in your editor and fill in the required values. At minimum, set `DATABASE_URL` to point to your local PostgreSQL instance (usually `postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name`). For a full list of environment variables, refer to the Environment Setup guide.

</Step>

<Step>

### Run database migrations

Apply the database schema to your local PostgreSQL instance:

```bash
npm run db:migrate:dev
```

This uses Prisma to create the necessary tables and relationships as defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`, setting up your database for the application.

</Step>

<Step>

### Start the development server

Launch the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will start at `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/docs` to explore the built-in documentation.

</Step>

<Step>

### Optional: Set up Stripe webhooks for billing

If you're working on payment features, start a local Stripe webhook listener in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run stripe:webhook
```

This allows you to test Stripe events locally. Follow the CLI prompts to configure the webhook endpoint and secret.

</Step>

</Steps>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify Your Setup

To confirm everything is working:

- The app should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Documentation is available at `http://localhost:3000/docs`.
- Your database is populated with initial tables; run `npm run db:studio` to open Prisma Studio and inspect the data.

## Troubleshooting

- **Database connection issues**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running and the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` matches the PostgreSQL service in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Missing environment variables**: Double-check that you've copied `.env.example` to `.env` and filled in all required keys. Next.js will show errors if critical variables are missing.
- **Stripe webhook errors**: Re-run `npm run stripe:webhook` and ensure you've set the webhook secret provided by Stripe CLI in your `.env` file.
