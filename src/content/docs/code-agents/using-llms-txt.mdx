title: Using llms.txt
description: Learn how the llms.txt standard helps AI agents discover and understand your documentation structure for better results.
---

By the end of this guide, you'll understand how the llms.txt standard works and how the SaaS Boilerplate leverages it to make documentation more accessible to AI agents like Lia.

## What is llms.txt?

The `llms.txt` standard is a simple convention that helps Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents better understand and navigate documentation websites. It's essentially a plain text file that provides a structured overview of your documentation, making it easier for AI tools to:

- **Discover content**: Quickly find relevant documentation pages
- **Understand structure**: See how your docs are organized
- **Get context**: Access high-level information about your project
- **Navigate efficiently**: Jump to specific sections without crawling the entire site

This standard was popularized by libraries like Next.js and has become a common practice across the developer ecosystem.

## How llms.txt Works

The `llms.txt` file is typically placed at the root of your website (e.g., `yoursite.com/llms.txt`) and follows a simple format:

```
# Project Name

Brief description of what this project does.

## Getting Started

- [Quick Start Guide](link-to-quickstart)
- [Installation](link-to-installation)
- [Configuration](link-to-config)

## Core Concepts

- [Architecture Overview](link-to-architecture)
- [API Reference](link-to-api)
- [Best Practices](link-to-best-practices)

## Advanced Topics

- [Performance Tuning](link-to-performance)
- [Troubleshooting](link-to-troubleshooting)
- [Contributing](link-to-contributing)
```

This structured format allows AI agents to quickly understand your project's scope and find the information they need.

## SaaS Boilerplate Implementation

The SaaS Boilerplate comes with `llms.txt` support built-in, making all your content (documentation, blog posts, help center, and updates) easily accessible to AI agents.

### Automatic Content Exposure

Your SaaS Boilerplate automatically exposes content through API routes configured in `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
// next.config.ts - Automatic llms.txt routing
async rewrites() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/docs/:path*.mdx',
      destination: '/api/content/docs/llms.mdx/:path*',
    },
    {
      source: '/blog/:path*.mdx',
      destination: '/api/content/blog/llms.mdx/:path*',
    },
    {
      source: '/help/:path*.mdx',
      destination: '/api/content/help/llms.mdx/:path*',
    },
    {
      source: '/updates/:path*.mdx',
      destination: '/api/content/updates/llms.mdx/:path*',
    },
  ]
}
```

This means any AI agent can access your content at URLs like:
- `yoursite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/llms.mdx`
- `yoursite.com/blog/announcements/llms.mdx`
- `yoursite.com/help/faq/llms.mdx`

### Content API Structure

The content is served through API routes in `src/app/(api)/api/content/` that automatically convert your MDX files into LLM-friendly formats. This includes:

- **Documentation**: All technical docs and guides
- **Blog posts**: Announcements, tutorials, and updates
- **Help center**: FAQs, troubleshooting, and support content
- **Release notes**: Version updates and changelogs

## Lia and llms.txt

While Lia comes pre-trained with deep knowledge of the SaaS Boilerplate and Igniter.js ecosystem, she can optionally leverage `llms.txt` files for additional context:

### Built-in Training vs. Dynamic Context

- **Built-in Training**: Lia has specialized knowledge of Igniter.js patterns, multi-tenancy, and SaaS Boilerplate architecture
- **Dynamic Context**: She can use `llms.txt` to access the latest documentation, blog posts, and project updates
- **Hybrid Approach**: Best results come from combining Lia's training with fresh content via `llms.txt`

### Practical Usage

When working with Lia, you can reference `llms.txt` content for:
- Latest API changes or deprecations
- New feature announcements
- Updated best practices
- Recent troubleshooting guides

## Popular llms.txt Resources

Many popular libraries and frameworks provide `llms.txt` files for their documentation. Here's a curated list of useful resources:

| Library/Framework | llms.txt URL | Description |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Next.js** | [nextjs.org/docs/llms.txt](https://nextjs.org/docs/llms.txt) | React framework documentation |
| **Better Auth** | [better-auth.com/docs/llms.txt](http://better-auth.com/docs/llms.txt) | Authentication library docs |
| **Zod** | [zod.dev/llms.txt](https://zod.dev/llms.txt) | TypeScript schema validation |
| **Prisma** | [prisma.io/docs/llms.txt](https://www.prisma.io/docs/llms.txt) | Database ORM documentation |
| **Fumadocs** | [fumadocs.dev/llms.txt](https://fumadocs.dev/llms.txt) | Documentation framework |
| **SaaS Boilerplate** | [demo.saas-boilerplate.com/llms.txt](https://demo.saas-boilerplate.com/llms.txt) | Live demo of this implementation |

## Implementing llms.txt in Your Project

If you're extending the SaaS Boilerplate or building your own implementation:

### Basic Setup

1. **Create the file**: Add `public/llms.txt` to your project
2. **Structure content**: Organize with clear sections and links
3. **Keep updated**: Regularly refresh with new content
4. **Test access**: Ensure the file is publicly accessible

## Best Practices

<Accordions type="multiple">
<Accordion title="Keep it Focused">
Don't include every single page—focus on high-value, frequently accessed content that AI agents would find most useful.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Maintain Structure">
Use consistent formatting with clear headings and logical grouping of related topics.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Update Regularly">
As your documentation evolves, keep the `llms.txt` file current to ensure AI agents have access to the latest information.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test with AI Agents">
Use tools like Lia to test that your `llms.txt` provides the context AI agents need for effective assistance.
