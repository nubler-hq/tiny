By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to use slash commands with Lia to automate development workflows in your SaaS Boilerplate project.

## What Are Commands in Code Agents?

Commands are custom slash commands (like `/setup` or `/create-command`) that trigger specific automated workflows in AI code agents. When you type a slash command in your chat with Lia, she executes a predefined sequence of actions designed to accomplish complex development tasks.

In modern code agents (Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Claude Code, etc.), commands provide a way to create "shortcuts" for frequently used workflows. Instead of describing what you want to do in natural language each time, you can use a command to trigger a specific, well-defined process.

## How Commands Work

When you interact with Lia, she automatically recognizes slash commands and executes the corresponding workflow. These commands influence:

- **Project Setup**: Environment configuration and dependency management
- **Code Generation**: Automated creation of components, pages, and features
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing, validation, and documentation workflows
- **Development Automation**: Streamlined processes for common tasks

## Commands in SaaS Boilerplate

The SaaS Boilerplate includes a comprehensive set of commands organized in the `.rulesync/commands/` directory. These commands are specifically designed for multi-tenant SaaS applications built with modern web technologies.

### File Structure
```
.rulesync/commands/
├── init.md                 # Personalized project onboarding
├── setup.md                # Environment configuration and dependencies
├── create-command.md       # Custom command creation workflow
├── create-rule.md          # Custom rule creation workflow
├── docs.md                 # Documentation generation and management
└── task.md                 # Complete feature development lifecycle
```

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/init` | Start personalized project onboarding and setup guidance |
| `/setup` | Guide through complete environment configuration and dependency installation |
| `/create-command` | Create new custom slash commands with proper structure and validation |
| `/create-rule` | Create new rules for training Lia and automating workflows |
| `/docs` | Generate and manage project documentation automatically |
| `/task` | Guide through complete feature development lifecycle from planning to deployment |

## Using Commands

To use a command, simply type it in your chat with Lia:

<Steps>

<Step>

### Start a chat with Lia

Open your preferred code editor and start a chat with Lia.

</Step>

<Step>

### Type the slash command

Enter the command you want to execute:

```
/setup
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Follow the guidance

Lia will guide you through any required prompts and questions.

</Step>

<Step>

### Review results

Once complete, review the generated files, code changes, or other outputs.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Creating Custom Commands

To create a new custom command for your project, you have two options: using the `/create-command` command for guided creation, or manually creating the command file.

<Tabs items={["Via Command", "Manual Creation"]} defaultIndex={0}>
<Tab>

Use the `/create-command` command in your chat with Lia to create a new command interactively.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Start the command

In your chat with Lia, type:

```
/create-command
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Define the command details

Lia will guide you through:

- **Command name**: The slash command (e.g., `/my-custom-workflow`)
- **Purpose**: What the command should accomplish
- **Workflow steps**: The sequence of actions to execute
- **Validation rules**: How to ensure the command works correctly

</Step>

<Step>

### Test and finalize

Lia will create the command file and allow you to test it before finalizing.

</Step>

</Steps>

</Tab>
<Tab>

Create the command file manually in the `.rulesync/commands/` directory.

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create the command file

Create a new Markdown file in `.rulesync/commands/` with a descriptive name:

```bash
touch .rulesync/commands/my-custom-command.md
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Add the command structure

Use this template as a starting point:

```yaml
---
description: "Custom command for [specific purpose]"
---

# /my-custom-command

## Overview
[Explain what this command does and when to use it]

## Workflow Steps
1. [Step 1 description]
2. [Step 2 description]
3. [Additional steps as needed]

## Validation
[How to verify the command worked correctly]

## Integration Points
[How this command works with other commands or rules]
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Customize the command

Replace the placeholders with your specific requirements:

- Update the `description` in the frontmatter
- Define clear workflow steps that Lia can follow
- Include validation criteria
- Document integration points with existing commands

</Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="multiple">
<Accordion title="Command Not Recognized">
**Problem:** Lia doesn't recognize the slash command you typed.

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're in an active chat with Lia in your code editor
- Check the command syntax (include the `/` at the beginning)
- Verify the command exists in the table above
- Make sure you're using the correct command name without typos
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workflow Issues">
**Problem:** A command workflow fails or doesn't complete properly.

**Solution:**
- Follow Lia's guidance step by step without skipping prompts
- Answer questions clearly and completely
- Approve automated actions when prompted
- Check for error messages and address them
- Contact support if workflows fail repeatedly
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Command Not Working as Expected">
**Problem:** The command runs but produces unexpected results.

**Solution:**
- Verify you're in the correct project directory
- Check that all prerequisites are met (dependencies, environment setup)
- Review the command output for specific error messages
- Try running the command again after fixing any issues
- Check the project documentation for command-specific requirements
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Integration with Rules

Commands work seamlessly with rules to provide comprehensive automation:

- **Setup Commands**: Use environment rules for configuration
- **Development Commands**: Apply coding standards and patterns
- **Testing Commands**: Follow validation and quality rules
- **Documentation Commands**: Use documentation standards
