By the end of this guide, you'll have Lia configured and ready to work in your preferred development environment.

## Configuring Lia with the CLI

The easiest way to set up Lia is through the SaaS Boilerplate CLI. Even after initial project creation, you can configure or update Lia at any time.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Run the Lia configuration command

```bash
npx saas-boilerplate@latest lia
```

This launches an interactive menu for managing Lia configurations.
</Step>

<Step>
### Choose your action

The main menu offers several options:

- **Initialize LIA on my Code Agents**: Set up Lia for your preferred development tools
- **Sync All Configurations**: Update all AI code agent settings across your environment
- **Update .gitignore**: Add Lia-specific patterns to your .gitignore file
- **Exit**: Close the menu
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure code agents (if selected)

When initializing Lia, you'll see a multi-select list of supported code agents:

- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Claude Code
- Codex CLI
- Gemini CLI
- OpenCode
- Cline
- Roo Code
- Qwen Code
- Kiro IDE
- Amazon Q Developer CLI
- JetBrains Junie
- AugmentCode
- Windsurf
- Warp

Select all the agents you use, then confirm to apply the configuration. This replaces their default training with Lia's specialized setup for the SaaS Boilerplate ecosystem.
</Step>

<Step>
### Verify the setup

After configuration, Lia will be ready to work in your chosen agents. Test her by asking for help with a simple task, like creating a new page or controller.
</Step>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="multiple">
<Accordion title="Lia not responding in my code agent">
**Problem:** Lia doesn't respond in your configured code agent.

**Solution:**
- Ensure you've run the CLI configuration for your specific agent
- Check that the agent's configuration files point to the correct project directory
- Verify that the project has the required `.mcp.json` and rule files
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Configuration not applying">
**Problem:** Changes to Lia's configuration aren't taking effect.

**Solution:**
- Try the "Sync All Configurations" option in the CLI menu
- Check for permission problems or conflicting agent configurations
- Restart your code agent after configuration changes
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MCP tools not working">
**Problem:** Lia can't access MCP server tools.

**Solution:**
- Verify that `.mcp.json` exists in your project root
- Ensure all required packages are installed
- Check for additional environment variables needed for authentication
