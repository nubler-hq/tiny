description: Meet Lia, your specialized AI Code Agent for the SaaS Boilerplate and Igniter.js ecosystem, designed to accelerate development and maintain high-quality code.
---

By the end of this guide, you'll understand who Lia is, how she integrates with the SaaS Boilerplate to supercharge your development workflow, and how to configure her using our CLI for seamless collaboration.

## Who is Lia?

Lia is an AI Code Agent built specifically for the SaaS Boilerplate and Igniter.js ecosystem. Unlike generic AI assistants, Lia comes pre-trained with deep knowledge of our framework, including Igniter.js patterns, multi-tenancy architecture, authentication flows, and billing integrations. This specialization makes her incredibly effective at scaffolding features, fixing bugs, and ensuring your code adheres to best practices without the trial-and-error of training a general-purpose agent.

When you create a new project with the SaaS Boilerplate CLI, you have the option to configure Lia as your code agent. This replaces the default training of popular agents like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or Claude Code with our custom setup, ensuring Lia is ready to work with full context of your project from day one.

## Lia's Mission and Core Objectives

Lia's work is guided by three key objectives that make her an indispensable part of building SaaS applications:

1. **Accelerate Development**: Lia handles complex tasks autonomously, from feature scaffolding to bug resolution, freeing you to focus on high-level strategy and user experience.

2. **Ensure Quality and Consistency**: As a guardian of your codebase, Lia enforces established patterns, maintains strict type safety, and ensures comprehensive test coverage. She follows our project rules in `.rulesync/**` to keep everything aligned.

3. **Build Persistent Knowledge**: Lia systematically captures and organizes project knowledge—architectural decisions, bug fixes, and implementation details—creating a living documentation system that grows with your project.

## The Birth of Lia: A Natural Evolution

Lia wasn't an afterthought—she emerged as a natural necessity during the development of the SaaS Boilerplate. As we built Igniter.js from the ground up as a framework optimized specifically for code agents, we realized that traditional AI assistants couldn't keep up with our innovative patterns and multi-tenant architecture.

Igniter.js was created with AI collaboration in mind, featuring built-in controllers, procedures, and job queues that work seamlessly with automated code generation. But to truly unlock its potential, we needed an AI agent that understood this ecosystem intimately. That's when Lia was born—designed from day one to work in perfect synergy with Igniter.js and the SaaS Boilerplate.

This integrated approach creates something truly unique: a development stack where every component was built to work together. While Igniter.js and Lia are completely open source, when combined with the SaaS Boilerplate's battle-tested foundation (authentication, billing, UI components), they deliver productivity that surpasses any other solution on the market.

### What Lia Can Do For You

Lia is your full-spectrum development collaborator, capable of transforming how you build SaaS applications:

**Strategic Planning & Architecture**
- Analyze complex requirements and break them into actionable development tasks
- Consider multi-tenancy implications and scalability from the start
- Propose implementation strategies that leverage Igniter.js patterns optimally

**Code Generation & Implementation**
- Generate production-ready controllers, procedures, and API endpoints
- Create UI components using our Shadcn-based design system
- Implement authentication flows, billing integrations, and business logic
- Write focused, minimal code changes with comprehensive test coverage

**Quality Assurance & Validation**
- Execute unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end browser testing
- Validate API endpoints and database operations automatically
- Run linters, type checkers, and security scans
- Ensure code adheres to your project's established patterns

**Knowledge Management & Documentation**
- Author comprehensive documentation in our MDX format
- Maintain TSDoc comments and API specifications
- Build and update project knowledge bases as your application evolves
- Generate decision records and architectural documentation





## Collaboration Patterns

Lia works best when collaborating with you in a structured way:

- **Planning Phase**: Lia proposes detailed plans and iterates based on your feedback
- **Implementation**: She creates targeted code changes with tests and documentation
- **Review**: Lia explains her changes and addresses any concerns
- **Validation**: She runs available tests and flags any potential issues

Lia always asks for approval before making destructive changes and never commits secrets or sensitive information.

## Best Practices for Working with Lia

<Accordions type="multiple">
<Accordion title="Provide Clear Context">
When asking Lia for help, include relevant file paths, user stories, or acceptance criteria. The more context you provide, the better her suggestions will be.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Review and Iterate">
Always review Lia's code changes. While she's designed to follow best practices, your domain expertise is crucial for business logic and user experience decisions.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Use Tools Appropriately">
Lia will suggest using MCP tools when relevant, but she always asks for your consent before executing potentially impactful operations.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Keep Knowledge Updated">
As your project evolves, Lia helps maintain documentation. Encourage her to update knowledge bases after significant changes.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="multiple">
<Accordion title="Lia not responding in my code agent">
Ensure you've run the CLI configuration for your specific agent. Check that the agent's configuration files point to the correct project directory.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="MCP tools not working">
Verify that `.mcp.json` exists in your project root and that the required packages are installed. Some tools may need additional environment variables for authentication.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Configuration not applying">
Try the "Sync All Configurations" option in the CLI menu. If issues persist, check for permission problems or conflicting agent configurations.
