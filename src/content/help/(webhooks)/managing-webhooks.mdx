## Introduction

The Webhooks page allows you to configure real-time event notifications that automatically send data to external systems when specific events occur in your SaaS Boilerplate workspace. Access it via Settings > Organization > Webhooks. This powerful feature enables seamless integrations and automations. By the end of this guide, you'll have webhooks set up to enhance your workflows.

<Callout title="Tip">Webhooks enable real-time integrations, reducing manual processes and improving responsiveness.</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- Owner or Admin access to organization settings
- A secure endpoint URL (HTTPS) to receive webhook payloads
- Understanding of the events you want to monitor
- API key or authentication method for your endpoint

## Core Concepts

### Webhooks
HTTP callbacks that send data to external URLs when events happen in your workspace.

### Event Types
Categories of events that can trigger webhooks:
- User events (created, updated, deleted, login)
- Organization events (member changes, settings updates, plan changes)
- Data events (lead creation, form submissions, data exports)
- System events (integrations connected, API keys generated, maintenance)

### Security
Webhooks require secure endpoints with authentication (API keys, signatures) and HTTPS.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
<Step>
### Access Webhooks Page
Navigate to Settings > Organization > Webhooks in the dashboard.
</Step>

<Step>
### Create a New Webhook
Click "Create Webhook" and configure:
- Name: Descriptive identifier
- URL: Your endpoint URL
- Events: Select which event types trigger the webhook
- Method: HTTP method (usually POST)
- Headers: Authentication headers if needed
</Step>

<Step>
### Test the Webhook
Use the test function to send a sample payload and verify your endpoint receives it correctly.
</Step>

<Step>
### Monitor and Manage
View webhook status, delivery logs, and success rates. Edit or delete webhooks as needed.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Webhook Configuration Details

<TypeTable
  type={{
    name: {
      description: 'Descriptive name for the webhook',
      type: 'string',
      default: 'Required',
    },
    url: {
      description: 'Secure endpoint URL to receive payloads',
      type: 'string (HTTPS)',
      default: 'Required',
    },
    events: {
      description: 'Event types that trigger the webhook',
      type: 'array',
      default: 'At least one selected',
    },
    method: {
      description: 'HTTP method for the request',
      type: 'string',
      default: 'POST',
    },
    headers: {
      description: 'Custom headers including authentication',
      type: 'object',
      default: 'Optional',
    },
  }}
/>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="multiple">
<Accordion title="Webhook not triggering">
Verify event types are selected and the webhook is active. Check if the event actually occurred.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Delivery failures">
Ensure the endpoint URL is correct, HTTPS, and accessible. Review authentication headers.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Payload format issues">
Check your endpoint's handling of JSON payloads. Use webhook logs to inspect failed deliveries.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Rate limiting">
Monitor delivery frequency and implement queuing if needed on your endpoint.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Best Practices

<Accordions type="multiple">
<Accordion title="Use descriptive names">
Name webhooks clearly to identify their purpose and associated systems.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Secure endpoints">
Always use HTTPS and implement authentication to protect against unauthorized access.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Monitor health">
Regularly check delivery logs and success rates. Set up alerts for failures.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Handle errors gracefully">
Implement retry logic and error handling in your endpoint to manage temporary issues.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Start small">
Begin with one or two event types, then expand as you verify reliability.
