<Callout title="Tip">Regular billing checks help you optimize costs and avoid service interruptions.</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- Active SaaS Boilerplate account
- Access to organization settings (Owner or Admin role)
- Understanding of your current plan and usage needs

## Core Concepts

### Subscription Plans
SaaS Boilerplate offers tiered plans with different limits on team members (seats), leads, submissions, and features. Plans scale with your business needs.

### Usage Limits
Each plan has limits on resources like team members and data entries. Monitoring usage prevents unexpected restrictions.

### Billing Cycle
Subscriptions renew monthly or annually. You can change plans or cancel anytime.

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
<Step>
### Access Billing Settings
Navigate to Settings > Organization > Billing in the dashboard sidebar.
</Step>

<Step>
### Review Current Subscription
Check your current plan, billing cycle, and usage statistics. The dashboard shows:
- Plan details and status
- Next billing date
- Resource usage (seats, leads, submissions)
</Step>

<Step>
### Monitor Usage
Review the usage section for each resource:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    seats: {
      description: 'Number of team members allowed',
      type: 'integer',
      default: 'Varies by plan',
    },
    leads: {
      description: 'Contact records you can store',
      type: 'integer',
      default: 'Varies by plan',
    },
    submissions: {
      description: 'Form responses you can collect',
      type: 'integer',
      default: 'Varies by plan',
    },
  }}
/>

Look for alerts when approaching limits.
