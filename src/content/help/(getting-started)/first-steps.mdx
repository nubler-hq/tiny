## Introduction

Welcome to SaaS Boilerplate! This guide will walk you through your initial setup, from creating your workspace to inviting team members. By the end, you'll have a fully configured environment ready for building your SaaS application.

<Callout title="Tip">The entire setup process takes less than 5 minutes. Let's get you started!</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- A valid email address for account creation
- Access to the SaaS Boilerplate dashboard
- Basic understanding of SaaS concepts (don't worry if you're new—we'll guide you through it)

## Core Concepts

### Workspace
Your workspace is the central hub for your organization, containing all your data, team members, and configurations. It's isolated from other tenants for security and scalability.

### Multi-Tenancy
SaaS Boilerplate uses multi-tenancy to ensure each customer has their own secure environment while sharing the underlying infrastructure.

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
<Step>
### Welcome and Introduction
Upon logging in, you'll see the welcome screen with an overview of SaaS Boilerplate's features. Click "Create my workspace now" to proceed.
</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Your Workspace
Choose a workspace name and custom URL slug. The name should reflect your organization or project, and the slug will be part of your unique URL (e.g., `yourdomain.com/workspace/your-slug`).

<Callout title="Warning">Workspace names and slugs must be unique. If your choice is taken, try variations like adding your industry or year.</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Personal Information
Provide your full name, phone number (with country code), and how you heard about SaaS Boilerplate. This information personalizes your experience and helps with account security.
</Step>

<Step>
### Invite Team Members (Optional)
Add team members by email and assign roles. You can skip this step and invite people later through the team management section.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

After completing the steps, you'll be redirected to your new workspace dashboard. Verify everything is set up correctly by checking your profile and workspace settings.

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions type="multiple">
<Accordion title="Workspace name or URL already taken">
Try alternative names or slugs. For example, if "acme" is taken, use "acme-tech" or "acme-2024". You can update these later in organization settings.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Form validation errors">
Ensure all required fields are filled. Phone numbers must include country codes, and emails must be in valid format. Check for red indicators on incomplete fields.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unable to invite team members">
Verify email addresses are correct. Invited users will receive an email with login instructions. If emails aren't arriving, check spam folders or contact support.
</Accordion>
