# Changesets

Hello! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## How to Use Changesets in SaaS Boilerplate

### For Contributors

When you make a change that should be included in the changelog and trigger a version bump, you need to create a changeset:

```bash
bun changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. **Select the type of change**:
   - `patch`: Bug fixes, minor improvements (0.0.X)
   - `minor`: New features, non-breaking changes (0.X.0)
   - `major`: Breaking changes (X.0.0)

2. **Write a summary**: Describe what changed and why

3. **Commit the changeset**: The changeset file will be added to `.changeset/` directory

### Examples

#### Adding a New Feature (minor)
```bash
$ bun changeset
# Select "minor"
# Summary: "Add real-time notifications system with SSE support"
```

#### Fixing a Bug (patch)
```bash
$ bun changeset
# Select "patch"  
# Summary: "Fix invitation dialog controlled input warning"
```

#### Breaking Change (major)
```bash
$ bun changeset
# Select "major"
# Summary: "Migrate from Better Auth v1 to v2 - requires manual migration"
```

### For Lia (Automated Agent)

**Lia is responsible for:**
1. Creating detailed changesets for every significant change
2. Following conventional commit standards
3. Ensuring accurate version bumping
4. Maintaining clean CHANGELOG.md
5. Creating GitHub Releases with comprehensive notes

**Lia's workflow:**
```bash
# After implementing changes
bun changeset

# Follow prompts, then commit
git add .changeset/*.md
git commit -m "docs: add changeset for [feature/fix]"

# Push to trigger automated release workflow
git push origin main
```

### Release Process

The release process is **fully automated** via GitHub Actions:

1. When changesets are merged to `main`, a "Version Packages" PR is automatically created
2. This PR updates:
   - `package.json` (version bump)
   - `CHANGELOG.md` (generated from changesets)
3. When the PR is merged, a GitHub Release is created automatically
4. Git tag (`v1.0.0`) is created

### Guidelines

- **One changeset per logical change**: If you're fixing multiple unrelated bugs, create separate changesets
- **Be descriptive**: The changeset summary becomes the changelog entry
- **Include context**: Explain WHY the change was made, not just WHAT changed
- **Link to issues/PRs**: Reference GitHub issues when applicable
