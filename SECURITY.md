# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support and patch security issues on the latest `main` branch and releases tagged within the last six months.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability:

1. Email the core team at `felipe@igniterjs.com` with a detailed report.
2. Include steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any mitigation details.
3. Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we confirm a fix or provide guidance.

We will acknowledge receipt within two business days and aim to provide an initial assessment within one week. When the fix is ready, we will coordinate disclosure and credit you for the discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure practices. Please refrain from filing public issues for security vulnerabilities until we have resolved them.
